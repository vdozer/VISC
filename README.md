## **Installation Tutorial**

1. **Clone the repository**  
   The script is lightweight (only about **3.3 KB**). Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/vdozer/VISC"
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   Enter it's directory and run it with:

   ```bash
   cd VISC && sh visc.sh
   ```

   The script will guide you through the installation process.  
   **Note**: If you choose to use `zsh`, the script will not configure it for you, VISC only supports configuring `bash`.
