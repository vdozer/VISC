## **Installation Tutorial**

1. **Download the Script**  
   The script is lightweight (only about **3.3 KB**). Download it using the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -LO https://vozer.xyz/visc/visc.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the script with:

   ```bash
   sh visc.sh
   ```

   The script will guide you through the installation process.  
   **Note**: If you choose to use `zsh`, the script will not configure it for you, VISC only supports configuring `bash`.
