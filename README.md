# Valentin's i3 config

Just a basic config that I use. The only dependencies are feh, flameshot  and alacritty. The recommended wallpaper is **wallpaper.jpg** (Yes, that's one of the default ElementaryOS wallpapers). To take a screenshot press Mod+Shift+Print, that will take a screenshot of your entire screen and paste it to the Pictures directory. Remember to remove the # and change directory at the end of the config file for feh to work.
